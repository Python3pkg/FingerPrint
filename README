This application is able to fingherprint both statically and dynamically an 
application.
This fingerprint can then be used to understand if the given application can 
run on another system.




 --  INSTALL  --

To install from source run

 # python setup.py install

This will install FingerPrint in your python. FingerPrint consist of:
 - a bunch of python module and submodule inside the FingerPrint module
 - magic.py
 - a command line called fingerprint

To run some unittest run

 # python setup.py test



 --  USE   --

To get some help on the commnad line you can simply type:

 # fingerprint -h 

Basically there are tree actions fingerprint can do:

 1. Create a swirl from a set of input file (flag -c). In this mode
    fingerprint will scan the list of files passed on the command line
    and it will output a swirl file containing all the dependency detected 
    in files.

 2. Display the content of a swirl file (flag -d). In this mode fingerprint 
    will print to stdout a detailed description of the input swirl. The input
    swirl can be specified with -f, or it will be the default output.swirl.

 3. Verify a swirl (flag -y). In this mode fingerprint scan the current system 
    for dependency listed in the input swirl and return 0 upon success or 1 upon
    failure. If verbose flag is given it will print also a list of unmet 
    depenencies.
